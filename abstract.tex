In the last years many researchers are focused on cutaneous feedback because it can be very useful in many context, in particular where is required a micrometer precision.
This paper presents some experiments aimed at evaluating the goodness of vibratory feedback a type of cutaneous feedback. The experiments are based on a master-slave system. The master consists of a particular camera that allows to mapping the movements of the user hand, and of a "glove" with some vibratory mini-motors that provide the vibratory stimuli to the user fingers. The slave is characterized by a three finger robotic hand with the particularity that many pressure sensors are distributed on the surface of the fingers and on the palm.
